Despite all the fancy technical jargon... machine learning is largely brute force. This is why it has taken 80 years (using ENIAC as touchstone) to get some mildly cool AI. What this video really gets wrong is comparing ML to organic learning. Yes ML is different then explicit programming in that it uses data to ultimately perform tasks... but that&#39;s not how human brains do it. This assumption that neural networks are at the center of human intelligence is an unfortunate misunderstanding and has digital computing on a brute force wild goose chase. The reality is that there is something far more procedural at the center of human intelligence.,@drewarnold6741,0,2025-02-07T05:57:43Z

"Beating the system - Crop and Claim everyday<br>Bitcoin can play a role in combating the challenges posed by Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). While CBDCs offer financial safety and stability, they lack the decentralized nature and potential privacy benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Here are a few ways Bitcoin can address the concerns related to CBDCs:<br><br><br>dont tell the lawyer<br>1. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning it is not controlled by any central authority like a central bank. This decentralization ensures that no single entity has complete control over the currency, reducing the risk of manipulation or censorship.<br><br><br>Don&#39;t tell your shadow your seed<br>2. Privacy: Bitcoin offers a certain level of privacy as transactions are pseudonymous. Users can transact without revealing their real-world identities, providing a degree of financial privacy that may be lacking in CBDCs, which are typically issued and regulated by central banks.<br><br><br>Hardware wallets are softer than rocks but harder than socks<br>3. Security: Bitcoin&#39;s blockchain technology provides a high level of security through its distributed ledger. Transactions are recorded and verified by a network of participants, making it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with the data. This inherent security feature can help protect against fraud and unauthorized manipulation.<br><br><br>We may all have sum<br>4. Financial Inclusion: Bitcoin has the potential to provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations globally. By leveraging Bitcoin&#39;s open and permissionless nature, individuals who do not have access to traditional banking services can participate in the global economy and have control over their finances.<br><br><br>Walk for than 15 minutes<br>It&#39;s important to note that while Bitcoin can address certain concerns related to CBDCs, it is not a direct replacement for them. CBDCs serve specific purposes within a country&#39;s financial system, such as supporting government services and monetary policies. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers a decentralized alternative with its own unique benefits.<br><br>Below is exactly how we provide the means for this above mentioned workings in progress..... <br><br>= Use this code to decipher üí¨<br>Spoken sentences Coded<br><br><br><br><br><br>E<br><br>12.359 %<br><br>T<br><br>8.952 %<br><br>A<br><br>8.050 %<br><br>O<br><br>7.715 %<br><br>N<br><br>6.958 %<br><br>I<br><br>6.871 %<br><br>H<br><br>6.502 %<br><br>S<br><br>6.290 %<br><br>R<br><br>5.746 %<br><br>D<br><br>4.537 %<br><br>L<br><br>4.030 %<br><br>U<br><br>2.805 %<br><br>M<br><br>2.591 %<br><br>C<br><br>2.378 %<br><br>W<br><br>2.354 %<br><br>F<br><br>2.181 %<br><br>Y<br><br>2.119 %<br><br>G<br><br>2.042 %<br><br>P<br><br>1.682 %<br><br>B<br><br>1.494 %<br><br>V<br><br>1.032 %<br><br>K<br><br>0.853 %<br><br>X<br><br>0.145 %<br><br>J<br><br>0.127 %<br><br>Q<br><br>0.099 %<br><br>Z<br><br>0.088 %<br><br>[<a href=""http://zez.am/blockchain]"">zez.am/blockchain]</a>",@NotCBDC,0,2024-02-15T02:58:32Z

"in the grand scheme of things, I suck at math. But I have been thirsty for ML/AI for the better part of 6 years. I get the jist of it but havent successfully made it click, and havent been able to do anything with it yet. It would be awesome to get Fireship to feature an indebt tutorial on how to get started with neural networks and build something that works. And how to debug and troubleshoot it when it doesn&#39;t. I hope the &quot;you need to be math guru to figure this out&quot; is just the early adoption baby steps of ML/AI, and that in the future anyone who knows how to code, can master the art of ML/AI. Perhaps some function library will arrive that will take the math out of the equation.

"Pretty good explanation, but not perfect in my opinion. You mention the acquisition, cleaning and division of data into training sets and test sets, which is true for so called supervised learning, but this isn&#39;t the case in all types of machine learning. Some problems have no clear data or an easy way to divide data, such as when using reinforcement learning to train agents to play games. In this example, the model learns by performing actions in a simulated game environment. So the data is generated on the fly, and it&#39;s not really possible to divide it into different sets.<br><br>Just wanted to clarify this because I think machine learning is commonly misinterpreted as supervised deep learning (not saying you did, but others might) when in reality it is much more. But I like that you&#39;re delving into these types of topics, and would love to see more of it!",@X4r1l,1,2021-09-09T18:39:21Z
