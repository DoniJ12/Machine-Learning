Yes ML is different then explicit programming in that it uses data to ultimately perform tasks... but that&amp;#39;s not how human brains do it. This assumption that neural networks are at the center of human intelligence is an unfortunate misunderstanding and has digital computing on a brute force wild goose chase.

       "4  Despite all the fancy technical jargon... machine learning is largely brute force. This is why it has taken 80 years (using ENIAC as touchstone) to get some mildly cool AI. What this video really gets wrong is comparing ML to organic learning. Yes ML is different then explicit programming in that it uses data to ultimately perform tasks... but that&#39;s not how human brains do it. This assumption that neural networks are at the center of human intelligence is an unfortunate misunderstanding and has digital computing on a brute force wild goose chase. The reality is that there is something far more procedural at the center of human intelligence.   \n",
