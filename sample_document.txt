The biting wind of the Ethiopian highlands whipped at Ayele's face as he hurried through the bustling streets of Bole, clutching a worn leather-bound book. March 25th, 2025, was a day of both hope and uncertainty for him, as he navigated the crowded marketplace towards the Ethiopian Airlines headquarters. He hoped to finally get a chance to speak to the CEO about his invention, a solar-powered water purifier that could solve the water scarcity issues plaguing many rural communities.
He pushed through the throng of vendors hawking their wares, the aroma of injera and spicy stews filling the air, a stark contrast to the dust and grit that clung to his worn clothes. He finally reached the airline's entrance, the imposing building a symbol of Ethiopia's progress, but also a reminder of the gap between the city and the countryside. He took a deep breath, the scent of coffee and hope filling his lungs, and stepped inside, ready to face the unknown.
